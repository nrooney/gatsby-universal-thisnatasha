Thank-you for visiting the site! Here's a little information about me; if you want more detailed information I suggest you visit my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-rooney-560a7b9/) or social media accounts linked in the footer. 

As and expert in Internet and Web I've worked with standards groups at IETF and W3C on both technical topics and ones which touch on process and policy. I have commercial development experience, as well as Engineering Manager experience running teams of developers delivering time-dependant and numerous web products. I'm moving into working more solidly on cloud technologies with a new organisation. Details on this move will follow shortly.

I'm a fan of Japanese pop-culture and travel. I lived in Japan for two years between 2014-2016 and I speak intermediate level Japanese. I also play a large number of video games; I enjoy all genres although favourites are RPGs, Action Adventure, Puzzle and near enough anything Nintendo!

I run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thisnatasha) which focuses on Japan Travel and another one of my passions: Disney Parks. I'm particularly interested in theming and ride tech (especially trackless rides), and planning excellent vacations! 

I currently live in London, one of my favourite cities. I'm very interested in visiting new places, let me know about the great things in your part of the world on social media.
